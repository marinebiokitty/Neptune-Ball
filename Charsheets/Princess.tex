You are an \pAtlantis{}n \cPrincess{\prince} who loves \cPrincess{\their} \cKing{\parent}, \cPrincess{\their} country, and \cPrincess{\their} forbidden \cDiplomat{\paramour} across the border in \pPacifica{}. You love to dance, love to explore, and tolerate diplomacy only for how it serves your other loves in life.

Born an \pAtlantis{}n \cPrincess{\prince}, your life should have been a dream. But you had to endure the pain of growing up without a \cQueen{\parent} for all these 23 years. You are told \cQueen{\they} left when you were two. It doesn't really matter though, because you don't remember \cQueen{\them} at all. Growing up, you often dreamed that your \cQueen{\parent} was still alive, and would just turn up one day, and everything would be perfect. If only life were so sweet.

Growing up without a \cQueen{\parent} has been challenging, but you spent a lot of time with your \cPlant{\uncle} \cPlant{}, head of the Explorer's Guild. You may even be more fond of your \cPlant{\uncle} than of your own \cKing{\parent}, since \cPlant{} always made time for you. You don't care that everyone thinks \cPlant{\they} \cPlant{\have} lost touch with reality. \cPlant{\Their} wild conspiracy theories are kind of endearing. And who knows, maybe \cPlant{\they} \cPlant{\are} even right about some of them.

You might have been able to cope with your \cQueen{\parent} leaving you, if your \cAriel{\sibling} hadn't followed in \cQueen{\their} footsteps when you were 10. \cAriel{} left for the human world via the darkest of magic (according to your \cKing{\parent}, at least). \cKing{\They} never really spoke of \cAriel{\them} much after that, but you noticed \cKing{\they} took higher doses of \cKing{\their} medication after that.

Of course your \cKing{\parent} {\bf does not know} that you know about it, but you've know for as long as you can remember that your \cKing{\parent} has been struggling with depression. You've made an effort to help \cKing{\them}, by covering for \cKing{\them} whenever possible, and trying to show \cKing{\them} that you at least care. You are very subtle about it though (for the sake of \cKing{\their} pride), and have so far avoided tipping \cKing{\them} off that you know anything about it.

But enough about your family, most of whom don't care about you. You spent your teenage years learning to dance. Whenever your \cKing{\parent} would forbid you to leave on an Explorer's Guild trip, you would counter \cKing{\them} history lessons with dance lessons.  You love to move, you love the freedom -- the escape, really -- that is dance. You are always looking for new dance forms. Meringue, the national dance of \pAtlantis{}, is fun -- but there must be other forms of dance.

As you grew up, you spent more and more time out with the Explorer's Guild and your \cPlant{\uncle}. You needed to get away from the palace that seemed so empty without your \cQueen{\parent} and \cAriel{\sibling}. Although time away from the castle was nice, you really didn't have anyone you could trust -- at least until you met \emph{\cDiplomat{\them}}.

You had gotten back late from an Explorer's Guild trip, and were making your way down to the kitchens for a late night snack when you literally ran into \emph{\cDiplomat{\them}}. Time stopped. You stared into each other's eyes for a heartbeat -- then two. You looked down shyly. You were grimy from a day of exploring, your bag still slung over one shoulder, and your jacket covered in mud. You tried to stammer out an apology at the same time as \cDiplomat{\they} did. After a moment, you recovered your poise and asked ``Would you like to join me in the garden?'' \cDiplomat{\They} said ``yes,'' and the rest was history.  It turned out that \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\were} a \pPacifica{}n diplomat named \cDiplomat{}, and the two of you can't see enough of each other. If only \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\were} royalty, you wouldn't have to hide your interest.

You started taking an interest in politics as an excuse to try to see \cDiplomat{\them} more often. When that wasn't often enough, you turned to your \cPlant{\uncle}. He arranged to have \cPriest{} help you sneak across  the \pPacifica{}n border. It didn't hurt that you were assisting in a noble cause. \cPriest{} has been working for years to find homes in \pPacifica{} for \pAtlantis{}n orphans. You never could understand why \cPriest{\they} had to sneak around doing it.

You always knew sneaking across the border was risky, but it all seemed so abstract until it finally happened. Your routine visit got you caught by the border patrol, led by the crown \cPrince{\Prince} \cPrince{\themself}. You and \cPriest{} were escorted back to the \pPacifica{}n capital, and into the castle itself. There you were interrogated, albeit politely, for what seemed like days by the \cPrince{\prince}. It was quite the dance for you to avoid revealing anything important. Just when things seemed darkest, \cDiplomat{} appeared. With a few well placed whispers in the ear of the \cPrince{\Prince}, \cDiplomat{\they} set in motion your release and safe return to \pAtlantis{}.

Your \cKing{\parent}, \cKing{\King} \cKing{} grounded you for several natural lifespans upon your return. Apparently getting caught in enemy territory is not something a \cPrincess{\prince} is supposed to do. Your \cKing{\parent} would prefer you stayed grounded, and out of the public spotlight, for a very long time, but the \pPacifica{}ns repeatedly requested to work with you. That was almost certainly \cDiplomat{}'s doing. 

With the fiasco that resulted from getting caught, it is clear that you won't be able to sneak over the border any more. Your \cKing{\parent} will be watching you like a shark. You have to find some legitimate means to see \cDiplomat{}. The treaty would actually simplify things a lot because if \pPacifica{} and \pAtlantis{} could be brought closer together, free movement across the border would be possible. On the other fin however, \cKing{\King} \cKing{} has been contemplating marrying you off to the \cPrince{\prince} of \pPacifica{}. That would be a problem.  If you can't get out of that, as a last resort, you could try to elope with \cDiplomat{}. You are pretty sure \cPriest{} could perform the wedding. Eloping would leave \pAtlantis{} in quite a pinch though, with no obvious heir. Publically declaring your interest in \cDiplomat{} wouldn't help much, either: even under the best of circumstances, royalty should only marry royalty, and only a royal marriage can seal the treaty. If only \cDiplomat{} were royalty\ldots

With the \cExExKing{} Ball approaching, \cDiplomat{}, the \cPrince{\prince}, and a small entourage of \pPacifica{}ns have been staying at the palace. Last night, you and \cDiplomat{} stayed up late talking. It's nice to talk to \cDiplomat{\them}, \cDiplomat{\they} always \cDiplomat{\simpleverb{listen}} to you, especially when you need to rant about your \cQueen{\parent}. Unlike your \cKing{\parent} and most of \pAtlantis{}, \cDiplomat{} doesn't believe the official story that your \cQueen{\parent} was kidnapped and killed by \pPacifica{}ns. \cDiplomat{\They} \cDiplomat{\have} found no proof in the extensive records of \pPacifica{}. Instead, \cDiplomat{\they} \cDiplomat{\simpleverb{agree}} with your theory that \cQueen{\King} \cQueen{} simply abandoned you in your early years and went off to who knows where, to do who knows what.  Since a bunch of guests from far flung parts of \pAtlantis{} will be at the Ball, you have some hope of gathering clues. It is a long shot, but maybe somebody has heard something. Your \cAriel{\sibling} \cAriel{} is probably your best bet. You also haven't talked to \cAriel{} in a very long time, and \cAriel{\they} also \cAriel{\simpleverb{deserve}} a piece of your mind for ditching you too.

You took a circuitous route back toward the palace from the secluded caves where you met \cDiplomat{} last night. You always meet in these caves, since you and \cDiplomat{} need to keep anyone from finding about your forbidden romance. As you flitted from shadow to shadow, you came near to the entrance to one of the other caves. Raised voices inside caused you to stop. They were hushed a moment later, and you couldn't help but drift closer, straining to hear more.  The voice had mentioned something about the treaty. What you heard next made your blood run cold. The two voices were discussing sabotage, and the consequential destruction of \pAtlantis{}. You couldn't recognize the voices, and you didn't dare get closer to try to see the speakers, but you are pretty sure one voice was \pAtlantis{}n since it knew a disturbing amount about \pAtlantis{}n politics. The other voice seemed unaware of much of \pAtlantis{}'s recent history, and you therefore assume them to be \pPacifica{}n.

Tonight is going to be wonderful. You just have to stop two unknown saboteurs, and find a way to be with \cDiplomat{}. Surely that is not so impossible?

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
  \item Find a way to be with \cDiplomat{}. If only they were royalty\ldots
  \item Organize a dance event before the banquet.  This is in its way a religious ceremony, and the Moon Goddess may help or hinder you based on your performance.
  \item Figure out who the two voices in the cave were, and stop them from sabotaging the treaty.
  \item Collect clues about what happened to your \cQueen{\parent}, \cQueen{\King} \cQueen{}.
  \item Learn as many new dance forms as possible.
  \item Cover for your \cKing{\parent} whenever necessary.
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Trivia]
  \item Merengue is the national dance of \pAtlantis{}.
