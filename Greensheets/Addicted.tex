You are addicted to \iDrug{}. Normally you would smoke \iDrug{}, but since that doesn't really work under water, you've been chewing it. To your great frustration, chewing is far less effective at calming your cravings. You can already feel your dose this afternoon fading, and you have none left. You will need to acquire more doses from the intermediary your dealer arranged, \cReporter{}. See the ``\mSpyBook{}'' membook for details of this mechanic.)

Throughout the evening tonight, you will have to continue to take doses of \iDrug{} or experience withdrawal symptoms. You must take a dose approximately \textbf{every twenty minutes}. This means over the course of the event, you will need 8 doses to stave off withdrawal entirely. If you don't get your doses on time, you start to experience withdrawal. Once you hit withdrawal, you go into a confused rage. You must make a knock out attack on the first person you see with your full CR. Once you have attacked someone, you must fall unconscious for 5 minutes. Withdrawal applies each time you don't get your dose.

\iDrug{} has some positive effects and some negative effects. Immediately upon consumption, it will boost your CR by 1 for 10 minutes.

{\bf N.B. If anyone in your family finds out about your addiction, give them the mem-packet related to this.}
