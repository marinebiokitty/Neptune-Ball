Finishing \cAriel{}'s shell amulet should be trivial. You just need to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the \sRunicCircle{}
\item Trace the circle in chalk
\item Spend 3 minutes in uninterrupted meditation with the shell amulet in your hands
\end{enumerate}

Once it is complete, things get a little tricker. You have to convince \cAriel{} that \cAriel{\they} can save \cAriel{\their} \cWillow{\mfn{daughter}{son}{offspring}} by putting the shell amulet around \cAriel{\their} neck and wishing for \cWillow{\mfn{her}{his}{their}} soul to be saved. The wish must be made with the words

``I wish for the soul of my unborn \cWillow{\mfn{daughter}{son}{child}} to be saved.''

This will trap \cAriel{} in the same kind of debt that you are trapped in. The spirits on the other side greatly appreciate new servants, and this will pay off your debts to the spirits - assuming \cAriel{\they} \cAriel{\simpleverb{stay}} alive long enough to be useful to them.

You should consider \cAriel{}'s debt to you resolved if you accomplish this.

If you get \cAriel{} to make the wish \emph{using those exact words}, give \cAriel{\them} your ``\mMEnvelope{\MYname}'' and tell \cAriel{\them} to open it.
