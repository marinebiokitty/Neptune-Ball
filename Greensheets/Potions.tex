The spells and potions a magician can use are based on their level. Spells are represented as ability cards and are used as instant abilities. All potions follow a standard brewing strategy (see below the list). Potions have distinctive colors and can be recognized by magicians by their color, though lay people don't know what color the different potions are. Potions are represented as item envelopes that {\bf must be obtained from the GM. TELL A GM WHEN YOU --START-- BREWING A POTION}. You cannot dump out or steal potions that you did not brew. (This is a kludge.)

Potions can be administered in two ways. A willing or helpless target can drink the potion, in which case, the person administering the potion should hand over the potion item envelope to the target. A conscious, but ignorant target can also be injected with a potion. The person administering the potion must successfully stick a certain number of stickers on the target without being caught in the act, by the target or anyone else. (Stickers can be acquired at the cauldrons. If caught in the act, tell your observer that you were clearly trying to prick your target with a small syringe.) If the potion requires multiple dots to be effective, these dots must be applied at least 1 minute apart, but do not lose effect until the potion is applied. It does not matter if the stickers are noticed and removed before all are applied. Dots are out of game knowledge for anyone except for the player applying them. The person who is attempting to administer a potion should then find a GM, explain who the potion is targeting, and hand over the potion. The GM will handle the rest.

\emph{There is no mechanic for leveling up in game.}

{\bf Each magician can only brew two potions at a time.} %%There will be 5 or 6 cauldrons (1 in banquet hall).

As a magician, you are aware of some of the spells and potions that magicians of different levels can make and cast. Here are the known spells and potions that may be useful this evening:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Level 1
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item Healing Potion (RED) - 15 minutes to brew. Can cure wounds (the target will wake up, fully healed after 10 seconds) and heal most poisons.\\ 
     {\bf Ingredients required:} \iSeaSnake{}, \iSeaFan{}
		 {\bf Dots required:} 1
     \item \aLesserDispel{} - Instant spell. Can completely remove a magical effect of level-2 or lower. Can be used on magical locks to increase your ``working hand'' size by 1. Can disrupt shape shifters momentarily.

     \item Poison (GREEN) - 20 minutes to brew. This poison can be only cured with a healing potion AND \aFirstAid{}/a medkit, OR an exceptionally powerful magical artifact.

   	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Many magicians also develop their own private spells and potions. \\

{\bf How to Brew a Potion:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Acquire the necessary ingredients.
	\item Inform a GM what potion you are brewing.
  \item Stand in front of ``\sEmptyCauldron{}'' for 1 minute. At the end of this time, destroy the ingredients (they have been consumed by the potion), swap the cauldron sign to ``\sFullCauldron{}'' and write down the color of the potion you are brewing. If you are interrupted or otherwise cease to tend the potion before the 1 minute is up, you retain the items.
  \item Return after the duration listed above. (Potions cannot over brew) If the potion is the Deadly Poison or the Resurrection Potion, spend 1 minute adding the additional ingredients at this time.
  \item Erase the color, swap the sign back to ``An Empty Cauldron'', and return to the GM to get your potion item card.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Illegal Magic:}\\
All poisons are strictly illegal in \pAtlantis{}. Additionally, for historical reasons, transformations are also illegal. Making or possessing any of these potions is a severe crime.

{\bf Dangerous Ingredients:}
Some ingredients are never meant for beneficial or benign potions. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \iHemlock{} is a powerful hallucinogen.  %%shapeshifter
\item \iSnails{} is very poisonous, even on its own. %%Deadly poison
\item \iPearl{} is  known to cause victims to become dangerously compliant, %%Love potion
\item \iManOfWar{} is able to alter the consumer's mind in dangerous ways. %%Buff potion
\item \iSquid{} is able to alter the consumer's body in dangerous ways.  %%shapeshifter
