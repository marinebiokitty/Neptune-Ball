\name{\gShapeshifter{}}

You have created a special potion that is unknown to other magicians. This potion causes the victim to become a shapeshifter permanently and undetectably - even the strongest magical detection will not be able to tell the difference between a victim of this potion and a natural shapeshifter, and it would take miraculous magical power to dispel it, far beyond any magician. It also has the useful property of healing the wounds of the target, and therefore being able to masquerade as a common, benign healing potion.

This potion is particularly finicky. It requires \iHemlock{}, a very rare \pPacifica{}n herb.

In order to administer the potion, the victim must either be a willing or helpless victim, or you may roll a 9 or 10 on a D10 (gm provided) while within 1 ZoC of your target. If you don't roll a 9 or 10, you can keep rolling until you do, or until someone stops you. If anyone asks you what you are doing, you must tell them that you look like you are trying to do something without the target's permission. If you succeed in your roll, give the potion to a GM to give to your target.

The potion is GOLD in color and takes 30 minutes to brew. 

The required ingredients are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \iHemlock{} (\cSpy{} is supposed to be providing you with this)
\item \iSquid{}
\item \iBarnacle{}
\end{enumerate}

This potion is brewed as any other potion would be.\\

{\bf How to Brew a Potion:}\\ %%MAKE SIGNS!!!
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Acquire the necessary ingredients.
	\item Inform a GM that you are brewing this potion.
  \item Stand in front of an unused cauldron for one minute. At the end of this time, destroy the ingredients (they have been consumed by the potion), swap the cauldron sign to ``Full of liquid'' and write down the color of the potion you are brewing.
  \item Return after the duration listed above and stir the potion for 1 minute. Put both hands on the sign for this time.
  \item Erase the color, and swap the sign back to ``An Empty Cauldron'', and return to the GM to get your potion item card.
\end{enumerate}
