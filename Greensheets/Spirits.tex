You feel a whole new realm awakening in your mind just beyond your awareness - and a piece of your soul slip away. The ensnarement of \cWitch{} has sent you deep in debt to the spirits, powerful entities in another realm who now have a stake in your soul.

You are now a magician, level 2 (change your $\alpha$ score to 2 to reflect this). As a magician, you have the ability to cast spells and make potions, but only up to your current skill level. While there is no way in game to increase your skill level, the whispers of the spirits have given you knowledge of the power they promise to you in the future.

You are not a born magician, and so instead, your power comes from the spirits. While they are very powerful, and can allow you to do almost anything once you learn to communicate with them, they extract a heavy price. You are already deeply in debt to them from the wish you just made. You will have to pay them back someday, somehow. The full impact of this has not hit you yet, but you feel deeply unsettled, frightened, and likely angry.

If you remove your amulet, you may not use any of your new abilities, but removing or destroying the amulet will not affect your debt. Only a miraculously powerful magical artifact could absolve you of your newfound predicament.
