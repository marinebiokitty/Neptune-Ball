%% This file sets up the Sign and Label datatypes and creates Sign and
%% Label macros.
%%
%% Signs generally represent interesting parts of game area, usually
%% as things posted on walls.  Labels represent other things, often on
%% or inside envelopes, that are part of complex mechanics.
%%
%% The default value for \MYloc will inherit location from the Place
%% or Sign most immediately up the ownership tree.  Override this by
%% setting \MYloc to anything (even blank).
%%
%% Sign is for full-sized signs that would cover most of a large
%% manila envelope; SignMedium is for signs sized to half-sized manila
%% envelopes; SignSmall is for signs sized for small manila envelopes
%% (the same size as item cards).  Label, LabelMedium, and LabelSmall
%% are analagous, but they don't have a \takedownby note at the
%% bottom.  You can always use a sign or label without an envelope or
%% with a differently-sized envelope.  Choose which based on
%% visibility and content.
%%
%% SignTiny is for signs you want to be hard to find; it is small and
%% does not have a \takedownby note.  SignDot is for a very small
%% "dot" which only has a title.
%%
%% SignStrip produces a strip of paper (without a \takedownby note)
%% with labels on the outside that show on both sides if you fold it
%% in half.  These are a convenient alternative to sub-envelopes. They
%% can also be used for "s-packets" taped to walls (see
%% Extras/README-s-packets).
%%
%% LabelCover produces a label similar to the cover to a research
%% notebook.  LabelPage, likewise, produces a page.
%%
%% EOG is for full-sized end-of-game signs.

  It may come to pass that the currently confirmed or acting ruler of \pAtlantis{} dies or is otherwise found unfit to rule. This can come about in a number of ways. They could be found mentally unstable, demonstrated to have usurped power from the rightful heir, be an illicit form of magical creature (such as a shapeshifter), or be proven to have committed treason. The supreme justice, judge of the highest court of the land may be summoned (find a GM or NPC) to verify any claim that the ruler is unfit. If any of these conditions can be proven to have come to pass, the monarch is then immediately removed. 

To determine who is next in line of succession, follow the list below until you find the first eligible candidate. Assume all classifications that could have multiple members (more than one male child for example) process in order of age. Women who marry into another line of succession forfeit their position in line for the throne of their old kingdom. Bastards of proven lineage are eligible. For example, a bastard cousin is considered in the line of succession as appropriate.

From the last \emph{confirmed} (not acting) ruler of \pAtlantis{} power passes to:
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Male children
\item Female children
\item Husband or Wife
\item Brothers 
\item Sisters
\item Brothers-in-law
\item Sisters-in-law

\item The Mother
\item Uncles on the {\bf Father's} side
\item Uncles on the {\bf Mother's} side

\item Male cousins on the {\bf Mother's} side
\item Female cousins on the {\bf Father's} side
\item Female cousins on the {\bf Mother's} side
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

If for some reason, no eligible candidate can be  found, the Council of Advisors will elect a new monarch in a closed meeting as soon as possible. (out of the scope of the game.)

If power passes to a new person, the acting monarch is considered only a steward until confirmed. If the discredited person manages to reestablish their eligibility before the acting monarch is confirmed they can re-assume power immediately. The process of actually confirming the monarch takes about a week and is the duty of the Council of Advisors.

In order to pass power to the acting monarch:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The supreme justice must preside over the ceremony
\item The eligibility of the candidate must be verified by at least 2 \pAtlantis{}ns (using the chart above).
\item They need to take an oath to protect \pAtlantis{} in front of 3 witnesses in addition to the supreme justice (at least 1 must be \pAtlantis{}n).
\end{enumerate}

Following the completion of the ceremony, NPC pages will inform everyone in game of the change.

\iTrident{} rightfully belongs to the acting ruler of \pAtlantis{}. The acting monarch should not hesitate to use his or her extensive authority to acquire  \iTrident{} if anyone is foolish enough to withhold it.

The answer begins when the sun rises. 

-----------------------------------------

One must learn the letters of their tongue before they may form the words of a great speech. Look to the four corners of the earth to hone your skill, then reveal your answer when you are ready.

Look to the natives of the West for sound council. They often warn that it is bad luck to begin with magical signs.

The warriors of the East portray themselves as justice, whose word is law. Their words are not to be trusted, however, as their every moral has a price.

Trust the priests of the North as they spread the holy word. They often advise that learning your letters is never the most important thing you can do - for to them, God comes first.

The pirates of the South are ever a pushy lot. They say that their interests come first, but you can never trust their words.

Though you have learned much of those around the world, you still do not have the key. Think on what you have seen as you lay down to rest - but keep your eyes and ears open.

There was once an old merman who had seen great sorrow in his life. He had lost his wife to \ppolio{}, and his children to the war. He was alone in his old age. He wished more than anything to see his family again.}

He journeyed for many days and nights, asking at every house he encountered, but none could -- or would -- help him. They said ``Go away, old man. Wishes are for the young.''}
  
  \emph{Eventually the old man found his way to the Angola plain, where he knocked on the door of a young mermaid's house, to ask if she knew of the \iWishingStone{\MYname}. The mermaid was sad and quiet, but she invited him in for a meal. The merman asked her why one so young and beautiful was sad. She explained that her dear brother had gone on a quest for the \iWishingStone{\MYname}. He found it, but before he could make his wish, he was killed by another, jealous of her brother's success. To embitter the story, the \iWishingStone{\MYname} vanished from the clutches of the murderer, rejecting one who would resort to violence.}
  
  \emph{The old merman was saddened to hear that even the young suffer such pain. He looked back at his own life, and thought that he had many good parts, and all was not dark. He therefore offered to wish for happiness in the mermaid's future, instead of seeing his own family again.}
  
  \emph{The mermaid smiled then. She got up, and went to a chest in the corner of her house. She drew from within it, a humble stone. She brought it back to the old man, and said ``You are worthy.'' She then melted away into sea foam, and was carried off on the current.}
