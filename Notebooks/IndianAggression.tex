\startnotebook{\nIndianAggression{}}

\begin{page}{first}

You have been talking to \cPrince{} for months about \pIndia{}, but \cPrince{\they} doesn't believe you. You'd better test the waters in \pAtlantis{} and figure out if the monarchy here is any more receptive. Talk to \cKing{}, or whoever is the current ruler of \pAtlantis{}, about \pIndia{}n aggression. Once you've learned what \pAtlantis{} thinks about \pIndia{}, turn to page \nbref{second}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{second}

Opposition at every turn. \pAtlantis{} is just as oblivious as \pPacifica{}. You must find proof to show \cPrince{} and \cKing{} to prove the impending danger to them. If only you could scry on \pIndia{}! But those spells take weeks to prepare. You have mere hours. \pAtlantis{} has possession of a scrying mirror, \iScryingMirror{} that could be the key. But first you will have to gather more information. Try talking to \cGeneral{} since \cGeneral{\they} is part of the Guardian's guild. (If \cGeneral{} is unavailable, you may go through \cGeneral{\their} papers in their room instead). Find out what information \cGeneral{} has on where an army might mass troops for war. Spend 2 minutes trying to gather this intelligence. Once you have done so, turn to page \nbref{third}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{third}

\cGeneral{} said something that reminds you of some of your own research. Return to your quarters and look through your documents until you find the name of the plateau south east of the Tasmanian Sea. Once you know it's name, turn to page \nbref{fourth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fourth} 

Well, you have a name now. All you need are coordinates. Where could you find a map? \pPacifica{} has never been on good terms with \pIndia{} and so has very few maps. The Explorer's Guild of \pAtlantis{} might have better maps. Get into the Explorer's Guild and take a \iMapOfIndia{}. (You may take a map of your choice from the ``\sPileOfMaps{}'' sign) Then, turn to page \nbref{fifth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{fifth}

Now that you know where to scry, you just need access to \iScryingMirror{}. Either persuade \cKing{\King} \cKing{}, or whoever else is ruling \pAtlantis{} at the moment, to let you borrow it, or follow the directions on ``\sArtifactThree{}'' to break in and take the mirror. Once you are in possession of \iScryingMirror{}, turn to page \nbref{sixth}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{sixth}

Locate a ``\sRunicCircle{}''. The \pAtlantis{}n Magician's Guild must have one somewhere. Use \iChalk{} to trace the circle if it has not already been chalked. Spend 2 minutes meditating undisturbed (this action is interruptible) in the middle of the circle to scry in the mirror. Once you have finished meditating, {\bf open \iScryingMirror{}} and turn to page \nbref{seventh}.

\end{page}

\begin{page}{seventh}

This is finally what you need to convince \cKing{} and \cPrince{}! Hurry and do so before it is too late. You must persuade them to include a military alliance in the treaty!

\end{page}
